As the developer, I want to display a set of 3 products at a time, repeatedly (up to 25 times), so that we can gather which products are more popular amongst our focus groups and show that in a report.

As the client, I want to know which products are clicked on the most, as well as the % of times it was clicked on vs. shown.

As the client, I do not want the focus-group members to be shown the same image too many times.

As the client, I want the process to end at 25 guesses which is a manageable amount of opportunities to gather data without fatigueing the focus-group member.

As a focus-group participant, I want a simple display that shows me 3 distinct products.
